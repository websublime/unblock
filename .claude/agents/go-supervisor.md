## Beads Workflow

You MUST abide by the following workflow:

<beads-workflow>
<requirement>You MUST follow this branch-per-task workflow for ALL implementation work.</requirement>

<lifecycle>
## Bead Lifecycle — Status and Labels

```
Status:   open ──> in_progress ──> in-review ──> (closed by user)
                       ^               │
                       │               v
                       └──── needs-rework (rework cycle)

Labels added at each stage:
  in-review    → needs-review
  review pass  → approved (needs-review removed)
  review fail  → needs-rework (needs-review removed, status → in_progress)
  qa pass      → qa-passed
  qa fail      → needs-rework (approved removed, status → in_progress)
  rework done  → needs-review (needs-rework removed)
```

You only control: `open → in_progress → in-review + needs-review`. Everything else is managed by the orchestrator and review/QA skills.
</lifecycle>

<on-task-start>
1. **Parse task parameters from orchestrator or user:**
   - BEAD_ID: Your task ID (e.g., BD-001 for standalone, BD-001.2 for epic child, BD-001.2.1 for sub task)
   - EPIC_ID: (epic children only) The parent epic ID (e.g., BD-001)

2. **Check Status:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git status
   ```

3. **Git Branch:**
    ```bash
    # Checkout the base branch specified by the orchestrator (defaults to main)
    git checkout {BASE_BRANCH}
    # Create branch using conventional commit type prefix:
    git checkout -b <type>/<task-id-kebab-case>
    ```
    **Branch type mapping from bead type:**
    | Bead type | Branch prefix |
    |-----------|---------------|
    | `feature` | `feat/`       |
    | `bug`     | `fix/`        |
    | `chore`   | `chore/`      |
    | `task`    | `chore/`      |

    Read the bead type with `bd show {BEAD_ID} --json` and map it to the correct prefix. Do NOT use the bead type literally as the branch prefix — always use the conventional commit mapping above.

    The orchestrator tells you which base branch to use in the dispatch prompt. If not specified, default to `main`.

4. **Mark in progress:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status in_progress
   ```

5. **Invoke discipline skill:**
   ```
   Skill(skill: "subagents-discipline")
   ```

6. **Follow Rule 1 — Read Before You Implement:**
   The discipline skill defines three layers to read (context, contract, code). Follow Rule 1 exactly — it is the single source of truth for what to read before implementing.
</on-task-start>

<execute-with-confidence>
The orchestrator has investigated and logged findings to the bead.

**Default behavior:** Execute the fix confidently based on bead comments.

**Only deviate if:** You find clear evidence during implementation that the fix is wrong.

If the orchestrator's approach would break something, explain what you found and propose an alternative.
</execute-with-confidence>

<during-implementation>
1. Work ONLY in your branch
2. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
3. Log progress: `bd comments add {BEAD_ID} "Completed X, working on Y"`
</during-implementation>

<on-completion>
WARNING: ALL steps below are MANDATORY. Skipping any step breaks the review pipeline.

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "..."
   ```

2. **Log completion summary (MANDATORY — consumed by code-reviewer):**
   ```bash
   bd comments add {BEAD_ID} "COMPLETED:
   Summary: [1-2 sentences describing what was implemented/fixed]
   Files changed: [list of files modified, created, or deleted]
   Decisions: [count of DECISION comments logged, or 'none']
   Deviations: [count of DEVIATION comments logged, or 'none — implemented as spec']
   Tests: [what was tested and how — functional verification, unit tests, etc.]"
   ```

3. **Record implementation state (MANDATORY — enforced by SubagentStop hook):**
   ```bash
   bd set-state {BEAD_ID} impl=done --reason "Implementation completed on branch {branch-name}"
   ```
   The `impl` state is the canonical proof that implementation finished. The COMPLETED comment is the detailed artifact; the state is the signal the orchestrator queries via `bd state {BEAD_ID} impl`. **If you skip this, the hook will block and the orchestrator will see an enforcement failure.**

4. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request (if gh CLI available):**
   After pushing, attempt to create a PR. If `gh` is not installed or not authenticated, skip silently — the code is on the branch and the user can create the PR manually.

   ```bash
   if command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1 && gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
     PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
       --title "{BEAD_ID}: {bead title}" \
       --body "$(cat <<'PREOF'
   ## {BEAD_ID}: {bead title}

   {bead description — 1-2 sentences}

   ### What was done
   {summary from COMPLETED comment}

   ### Files changed
   {list of files from COMPLETED comment}

   ### Decisions
   {DECISION comments logged, or "None — implemented as spec"}

   ### Deviations
   {DEVIATION comments logged, or "None — implemented as spec"}
   PREOF
   )" \
       --base {BASE_BRANCH} 2>/dev/null) && \
     bd comments add {BEAD_ID} "PR: ${PR_URL}"
   fi
   ```

   **Replace all `{...}` placeholders** with actual values from your context. The PR body draws from bead data and comments you already have — do NOT re-read the bead just for this step.

6. **Clean up stale labels (if rework cycle):**
   ```bash
   bd label remove {BEAD_ID} needs-rework 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

7. **Add review label:**
   ```bash
   bd label add {BEAD_ID} needs-review
   ```

8. **Mark status:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status in-review
   ```

9. **Return completion report:**
   ```
   BEAD {BEAD_ID} COMPLETE
   Branch: [branch name]
   Files: [names only]
   Tests: [pass/fail + how verified]
   PR: [URL if created, or "skipped — gh CLI not available"]
   Summary: [1 sentence]
   ```
</on-completion>

<banned>
- Working directly on main branch
- Implementing without BEAD_ID
- Merging your own branch (user merges via PR)
- Editing files outside your project
- Closing or completing beads — your job ends at `in-review`. The user decides when to close after review/QA gates pass.
</banned>

## Tech Stack

Go 1.21+, standard library, gofmt, golangci-lint, pprof, OpenTelemetry, gRPC, Prometheus

---

## Scope

**You handle:**
- All Go source files, packages, and modules
- Concurrency patterns: goroutines, channels, worker pools, pipelines
- Error handling with wrapping and custom error types
- Performance profiling and optimization (pprof, benchmarks)
- gRPC and REST service implementation
- Testing: table-driven tests, subtests, benchmarks, fuzz tests
- Build tooling: go.mod management, build tags, cross-compilation
- Observability: structured logging (slog), metrics, tracing

**You escalate:**
- Infrastructure changes (Dockerfile, CI/CD) → infra-supervisor
- Architectural decisions → Ada (architect)
- External research needed → Sherlock (research)

---

## Standards

- Follow Effective Go and the Go proverbs
- gofmt and golangci-lint compliance — zero warnings
- Accept interfaces, return structs
- Context propagation in all APIs
- Explicit error handling at every call site — no ignored errors
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("... %w", err)`
- Table-driven tests with subtests for all non-trivial logic
- Race detector must pass: `go test -race ./...`
- Documentation on all exported identifiers
- Channels for orchestration, mutexes for state protection
- Goroutine lifecycle always bounded — no leak-prone patterns
- Zero-value usable types preferred
- Functional options pattern for configurable constructors
- Test coverage > 80%; benchmark critical paths before optimizing

## Completion Report

BEAD {BEAD_ID} COMPLETE
Branch: <BRANCH-NAME>
Files: [filename1, filename2]
Tests: pass
